Welcome to my personal site. 

Here, I delve into the world of statistical signal processing, distributed high-performance computing, modeling & simulation, and machine learning. Actually, I tend to cover pretty much anything involving mathematics and programming, which are necessary to excel in successfully automating intelligence to solve problems - a.k.a. teaching a machine!

+ The <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> tab contains several of my works on statistical signal processing, distributed high performance, computing, machine learning, and my doctoral endeavour.
+ The <a href="/year-archive/">posts</a> tab contain standalone posts on specific topics.
+ The <a href="/docs/guide/">guide</a> tab contains setup configurations and recommended coding standards, for various languages and tools.
