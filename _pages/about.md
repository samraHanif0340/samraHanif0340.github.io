Adaickalavan received B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2010 and 2014, respectively. His Ph.D. was in Statistical Signal Processing and Adaptive Filter Theory, and was applied to the field of Optical Communication <a href="/portfolio/cwdaml_and_adaptivecwda/">receiver design</a>. His Ph.D. advisors were [Prof. Kam Pooi Yuen](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elekampy/) and [Prof. Kim Hoon](https://sites.google.com/site/hoonkimlabs/people).

From 2014 to 2017, he was a R&D Engineer - Statistical Signal Processing and Machine Learning, at NXP Semiconductors Singapore, where he (i) lead the Type-B NFC ASK/PSK digital baseband receiver design and (ii) was engaged in temporary traffic sign recognition tasks using convolutional neural networks for self driving car application. Since 2017, he has been a Senior R&D Engineer - Machine Learning, with Panasonic Singapore, working on intelligent driver distraction state modeling and prediction via deep learning from face and eye sensor data. 

His research interest includes machine learning, deep learning, artifical intelligence, and digital signal processing. He has worked on machine learning problems in the fields of object tracking, pattern classification, image recognition, and real-time-series data. Strong in mathematical modelling, stochastic processes, optimization theory, algorithm development, and bench-top experimental skills. 

Dr. Adaickalavan is a member of [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers - IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html). He is an ad-hoc reviewer for (i) [Optics Express - Optical Society of America](http://www.osa.org/en-us/home/), (ii) [Photonics Technology Letters - IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=68), and (iii) [Electronic Letters - IET](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/el).
