## Info

This project addresses an extended problem to that of the original [Parking Lot Problem](https://adaickalavan.github.io/portfolio/parking_lot_problem/).

## Problem Statement

In this extended problem, the carpark should accept three different types of vehicles, namely, motorcycle, car, and bus, requiring 1, 2, and 3 parking slots per vehicle, respectively.

| Type of vehicle   |  Number of parking slots needed per vehicle |
|:-----------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
| Motorcycle        |                      1                      |
| Car               |                      2                      |
| Bus               |                      3                      |

All other rules, regulations, and operational requirements of the carpark remain the same as in the original problem.

An example in the interactive mode is as follows.

**Example: Interactive**

```
$ create_parking_lot 8
Created a parking lot with 8 slots
$ park KA-01-HH-1234 White motorcycle
Allocated slot number: 1
$ park KA-01-HH-9999 White car
Allocated slot number: 2
$ park KA-01-BB-0001 Black bus
Allocated slot number: 4
$ leave 1
Slot number 1 is free
$ park KA-01-HH-2701 Blue car
Allocated slot number: 7
$ leave 4
Slot number 4 is free
$ park KA-01-HH-7777 White car
Allocated slot number: 4
$ status
Slot No. Registration No  Colour  Type
2        KA-01-HH-9999    White   Car
4        KA-01-HH-7777    White   Car
7        KA-01-HH-2701    Blue    Car
$ park DL-12-AA-9999 White bus
Sorry, parking lot is full
$ registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White
KA-01-HH-9999, KA-01-HH-7777
$ slot_numbers_for_cars_with_colour White
2, 4
$ slot_number_for_registration_number KA-01-HH-2701

$ registration_numbers_for_cars_with_colour Green

$ slot_number_for_registration_number MH-04-AY-1111

$ exit
```

## Learning Outcome

At the end of this project, we should be able to:

+ solve the Parking Lot problem with data structures optimized for complexity
+ utilize linked-list data structure in Go

## Project structure

The project structure is as follows:

```

## Notes on solution

1. **Data structures**
   + A sorted linked-list data structure is used to maintain the list of sorted empty slots in ascending order, instead of a minheap data structure used in the original problem.
